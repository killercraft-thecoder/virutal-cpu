## Notes

- **Addressing modes**:

  - **abs** â€” Absolute addressing; a full 16â€‘bit address operand is provided.
  - **rel** â€” Relative addressing; an 8â€‘bit signed offset is applied to the program counter (PC) relative to the next instruction.

- **Processor status flags** (in the `P` register):

  - **N** â€” Negative flag. Set if the result of the last operation has bit 7 = 1.
  - **Z** â€” Zero flag. Set if the result of the last operation is zero.
  - **C** â€” Carry flag. Set if an addition produces a carry out of bit 7, or a subtraction does not require a borrow.
  - **V** â€” Overflow flag. Set if a signed addition or subtraction results in a value outside the range âˆ’128 to +127.
  - **H** â€” Halt flag. Set when the CPU is halted; execution stops until reset.
  - **I** â€” Interrupt disable flag _(currently unused)_. Intended to mask interrupt handling when implemented.
  - **B** â€” Break flag _(currently unused)_. Reserved for software breakpoints or system calls.

- **Flag updates**:
  - All arithmetic and logical operations update **N** and **Z**.
  - ADD/SUB and their variants also update **C** and **V**.
  - Flagâ€‘only operations (e.g., `CLC`, `CLF`, `CLN`, `CLZ`) directly modify specific bits in `P` without affecting others.

## Clock Rate

In a hypothetical hardware implementation using technology comparable to late 1970s or early 1980s microprocessors, this CPU would be expected to operate reliably at approximately **3â€¯MHz**. At this frequency, and given the average cycles per instruction for the current instruction set, the effective throughput would be on the order of 1â€¯MIPS. This performance is consistent with higherâ€‘end home computers of the early 1980s, while remaining well within the capabilities of periodâ€‘appropriate memory and peripheral interfaces.

## Performance

At the nominal clock rate of 3â€¯MHz, and assuming an average instruction cost of 3â€“4 clock cycles, the CPU achieves an effective throughput of approximately **0.75â€“1.0â€¯MIPS** (million instructions per second, this is approxmate and ausmes 3-4 clock cycles on avarge per isntrtion). This is comparable to the performance of higherâ€‘end home computers of the early 1980s, while remaining well within the capabilities of periodâ€‘appropriate memory and peripheral hardware.

The table below shows estimated effective instruction throughput at several representative clock rates:

| Clock Rate | Avg. Cycles/Instr | Approx. MIPS |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 1â€¯MHz      | 3â€“4               | 0.25â€“0.33    |
| 2â€¯MHz      | 3â€“4               | 0.50â€“0.66    |
| 3â€¯MHz      | 3â€“4               | 0.75â€“1.00    |
| 4â€¯MHz      | 3â€“4               | 1.00â€“1.33    |

## Historical Comparison

For context, the estimated performance of this CPU at 3â€¯MHz (â‰ˆâ€¯0.75â€“1.0â€¯MIPS) places it in the same general class as many popular home computers of the early 1980s:

| CPU / System                    | Year | Clock Rate | Approx. MIPS |
| ------------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------ |
| MOS 6502 (Appleâ€¯II, C64)        | 1977 | 1.0â€¯MHz    | ~0.3â€“0.5     |
| Zilog Z80 (TRSâ€‘80, ZX Spectrum) | 1976 | 3.5â€¯MHz    | ~0.8â€“1.0     |
| Motorola 68000 (Amiga, ST)      | 1984 | 7.16â€¯MHz   | ~1.0â€“1.2     |
| **This CPU (hypothetical HW)**  | â€”    | 3.0â€¯MHz    | ~0.75â€“1.0    |

While not matching the raw throughput of later 16/32â€‘bit processors, this design would have been competitive with â€” and in some cases faster than â€” many 8â€‘bit systems of its era. In the early 1980s, performance in the 1â€¯MIPS range was considered highâ€‘end for consumer hardware, approaching the capabilities of earlier workstationâ€‘class machines.

## Design Era Context

A CPU of this performance class and clock rate would have been wellâ€‘suited to the demands of earlyâ€‘ to midâ€‘1980s home computing. At approximately 1â€¯MIPS, it could comfortably support textâ€‘based applications, 2D tileâ€‘based or spriteâ€‘driven games, simple graphical user interfaces, and basic productivity software such as word processors and spreadsheets. Systems in this range were also capable of handling modest realâ€‘time control tasks, educational software, and early networking or modemâ€‘based communications. While not intended for heavy 3D graphics or largeâ€‘scale multitasking, such a processor would have provided a responsive, versatile platform for the eraâ€™s typical workloads.
